# Semantic Analysis and Document Classification - A Basic Model

## Features

- Extracts text from uploaded PDF files.
- Classifies documents into categories: `Resume`, `Medical`, `Legal`, `Financial`, and `Other`.
- Uses **BERT embeddings** via SentenceTransformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for deep semantic understanding.
- Performs keyword and context-based scoring using **spaCy** to improve classification accuracy.
- Stores and updates document vectors in **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) index for efficient similarity search.
- Visualizes document embeddings using **t-SNE** for intuitive inspection of document clusters.
- Automatically organizes PDFs into labeled folders for easy access.

### Why this model?

We use `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, a sentence embedding model from the SentenceTransformers library. It is a distilled version of BERT (MiniLM) that efficiently captures deep semantic relationships between texts.

Unlike traditional methods like TF-IDF, this model understands context â€” for example, distinguishing between "bank" as a financial institution vs. "bank" of a river. It converts documents into dense vector embeddings, which are then used for semantic classification and similarity search.

This model was chosen because:

- It provides high-quality embeddings for semantic understanding.
- It is lightweight and fast, making it suitable for real-time tasks.
- It works seamlessly with FAISS for efficient similarity-based indexing and retrieval.
